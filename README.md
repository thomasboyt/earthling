An experiment in React without the boilerplate.

This was split from the codebase from another React site generator I worked on called Peridot, so if you see anything weird/not working, it's probably because of that.

*this doesn't work yet, but eventually...*

```
npm install -g earthling
earthling new my-app
cd my-app
earthling serve
```
